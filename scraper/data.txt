I see most of the interesting comments here so far are from a strictly American perspective, 
that is just commenting on what was happening in the United States then or is happening in the United States now.
But of course there is more than one country in the world. In another place I have lived[1] a supposedly democratic 
government that in fact was a dictatorship engaged in comprehensive spying on all civil society organizations--not 
just the organizations that were formally opposition organizations--and stifled all mass media organizations with 
censorship. That didn't stop a people-power democracy movement from starting and succeeding 
in democratizing that country. I've advised Hacker News participants before[2] 
that people power democracy movements to overthrow dictatorships with comprehensive surveillance 
programs are not easy, but they can succeed. You and I need mental toughness, persistence, and 
courage to be part of the solution, but what better reward for those virtues is there than expanded 
freedom (and the dignity of knowing you did the right thing)? Don't give up. Keep on organizing to gain 
freedom and protect civil rights.
tl;dr: I'm the father of a hacker. I have no role in curating this site. I'm just one of thousands of participants like you. The Hacker News welcome messagehttp://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.htmlgives an overview of the community experiment here, summarizing the site guidelines.http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.htmlThe Hacker News FAQhttp://ycombinator.com/newsfaq.htmlgives some additional details about how Hacker News is administered. The welcome message distills the basic rules into a simple statement: "Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads."I really like this editorial from Australia about the issue that has been most discussed on HN since early June 2013, namely Edward Snowden's allegations about NSA activities:http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/some-secrets-best-remain/story-e6frg6z6-1226680991786My most controversial (gauged by variance in karma as downvotes and then upvotes rolled in) ever comments were about Snowden's role in today's world. I'd be glad to see NSA surveillance programs under much more strict legal scrutiny and oversight by Congress. But I can't count Snowden as a hero any more than I can count Kim Philby as a hero. Both were misguided and ultimately unhelpful to the world in some of the same ways. Here are my controversial comments, the first one a reply to the top comment in that thread, which will lead you to much disagreement from other HN participants.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6870263A later comment that was every bit as controversial was a top-level (but heavily downvoted) comment about the submitted story.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6958017I forget how ignorant many hackers are about the facts of the world until I see threads like those.My screen name here, "tokenadult," originated on other sites, and I acknowledge that it doesn't fit well here.http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1199939http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2493266The name has been controversial,http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4087129but I use it with explicit permission from the site founder (I asked him) and feel like I'm stuck with it here after using it for so many years and so many hundreds of comments.I'm founding director and math coach for Edina Center for Academic Excellence (my "startup," actually a nonprofit organization), parent workshop director for Epsilon Camp, past president (current director) of the Minnesota Council for the Gifted and Talented (volunteer), and homeschooling father of four children (one now living independently and developing his career as a hacker in New York City's startup scene). I am very interested in research on mathematics education and education reform in general. I hope hackers come up with innovations that disrupt and improve primary, secondary, and higher education around the globe. Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123and I'm glad to see that so many participants, from the founder on to the newest member, enjoy thinking about and checking facts on education issues.Because I have worked the last several years as a teacher of voluntary, supplemental classes in prealgebra mathematics for advanced elementary-age learners, I have had the opportunity to review mathematics textbooks in the original English and Chinese and in English translation from China, Taiwan, many publishers in the United States, India, Canada, Singapore, Japan, and Russia. I have used those materials and many articles by mathematics education researchers to prepare class materials for the classes I teach. The parents of my students have come from India, China, Russia, Korea, Vietnam, Ghana, Haiti, Australia, Pakistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Romania, Poland, and various parts of the United States. All of the parents are aware that United States schools don't meet a "world standard" in mathematics education, and look for something better for their children. I'd like to see every child everywhere have the opportunity to have the best possible primary education.For good information to add to Hacker News discussions, I highly recommend the online bibliographies"Intelligence Citations,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitationsand "Anthropology, Human Biology, and Race Citations,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitationswhich lead to many reliable sources that would do much to elevate the discussion here. I am a page maintainer of the Wikipedia article "IQ classification,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classificationand invite your comments on that article.I post from Minnetonka, Minnesota. I live in a neighborhood such that my family can walk or bike to the public library, most of our shopping, a nature trail, the friendly local high school, and an extensive network of regional bicycle trails. I have been to every state of the United States (and to DC and to Guam). I have lived in Taiwan (two three-year stays, one before and one after Taiwan became a free, developed country) and have traveled to Hong Kong, China, Japan, and Canada.Education: undergraduate degree in Chinese language, with elective courses in other languages and in linguistics. J.D. magna cum laude, law review. Languages I have studied include (Modern Standard) Chinese to a proficiency level sufficient for employment as a translator and consecutive interpreter, German for reading professional materials, Japanese, Russian, other Sinitic languages, the original languages of the Bible, samplings of Latin and of various Romance languages, interesting constructed languages (conlangs), and others.Experience: English as a second language teaching, Chinese-English interpreting, Chinese-English translation, judicial clerk for state supreme court, immigration law practice, service on various nonprofit boards, Edyth May Sliffe award for mathematics coaching.After letting it lie fallow for more than a decade, I have begun recoding my personal website, Learn in Freedom,http://learninfreedom.org/to HTML5 standards as part of celebrating the site's seventeenth birthday. During 2014, the site's nineteenth year, I hope to do many content upgrades on the site, and I encourage Hacker News participants who visit Learn in Freedom to comment on my Hacker News "Ask HN: Please Critique My (Tokenadult's) Website" threadhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5094480or use the on-site comment form links, or the email links to the webmaster, or my postal address, to reach me with your thoughtful ideas on how to improve the site. Thanks for your kind--or blunt--suggestions. The suggestions I have already received are now in my to-do queue (but are crowded to low priority by work and parenting tasks). Yes, to be clear about that issue, I ("tokenadult" on HN and two other discussion sites) am the same person as Karl M. Bunday, the founder and webmaster of Learn in Freedom, and you may call me Karl in emails or in comments on Hacker News.METAINFORMATIONHere are some questions I've asked or comments I've made to the Hacker News community over the years about the Hacker News community itself. I'd be glad to hear your point of view on these issues.Ask HN: How Can I Make Better Submissions to HN?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=419539Ask HN: What Kinds of Comments Should Be Upvoted?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1065084Ask HN: How Can We Help Make HN a Better Online Community?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3174656Ask HN: What do you like about the Hacker News community?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4399678Ask HN: What is the consensus on Hacker News?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4489216Ask HN: Whose Hacker News Comments Do You Follow?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4529466Suggest HN: Submit Reliable Sources with Original Titles &amp; Canonical URLshttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4624933A top-level comment under a thread titled, "Donâ€™t believe everything you read"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5105664
