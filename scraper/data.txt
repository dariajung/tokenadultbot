I see most of the interesting comments here so far are from a strictly American perspective, 
that is just commenting on what was happening in the United States then or is happening in the United States now.
But of course there is more than one country in the world. In another place I have lived[1] a supposedly democratic 
government that in fact was a dictatorship engaged in comprehensive spying on all civil society organizations--not 
just the organizations that were formally opposition organizations--and stifled all mass media organizations with 
censorship. That didn't stop a people-power democracy movement from starting and succeeding 
in democratizing that country. I've advised Hacker News participants before[2] 
that people power democracy movements to overthrow dictatorships with comprehensive surveillance 
programs are not easy, but they can succeed. You and I need mental toughness, persistence, and 
courage to be part of the solution, but what better reward for those virtues is there than expanded 
freedom (and the dignity of knowing you did the right thing)? Don't give up. Keep on organizing to gain 
freedom and protect civil rights.
